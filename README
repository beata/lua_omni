This is (still kind of preliminary version) of my omni completion plugin for
Lua. It works by scanning _G and parsing Vim buffers. Nested tables are
supported so you can type:
:lua foobar = {numbers = {one = 1, two = 2, three = 3}}

Then typing CTRL-X CTRL-O list of possible matches will open:
  foobar.numbers.one
  foobar.numbers.two
  foobar.numbers.three

Actually you can use globbing "*" and "?" characters to speed up typing like:
  f*tw CTRL-X CTRL-O
will output immediately:
  foobar.numbers.two

That is the new way of doing omni from this version. I've found it to be quicker
and more convenient than multiple hitting CTR-X CTRL-O.
Local variables completion works as before.


Some other functions are supported like listing defined Lua functions in
current buffer.
There are common Lua abbreviation defined in lua_omni.vim too.
